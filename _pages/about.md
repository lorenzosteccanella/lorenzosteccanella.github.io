I received my Ph.D. from the [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml) in 2023. 
My research interests are in the area of Reinforcement Learning, with a focus on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and long horizon decision making. I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the same group.

Before moving to Barcelona I have been working in two other laboratories:

- [Blue Brain Project EPFL](https://bluebrain.epfl.ch/) developing Deep Neural Network for generative vision problems.

- [University of Verona Intcatch Project](http://intcatch.eu/), developing Deep Learning systems for vision and localization systems for mobile robots.

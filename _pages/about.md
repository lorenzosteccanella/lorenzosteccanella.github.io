I received my Ph.D. from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in 2023, where I specialized in 
Reinforcement Learning. My research primarily focuses on Hierarchical Reinforcement 
Learning and long-horizon decision-making. Currently, I am working as a Postdoctoral 
Researcher within the same group, continuing to explore and innovate in these areas.

Before moving to Barcelona I have been working in two other laboratories:

- At the [Blue Brain Project EPFL](https://bluebrain.epfl.ch/), I developed Deep Neural Networks for generative vision problems, significantly improving rendering speeds and image reconstruction techniques.

- At the [University of Verona Intcatch Project](http://intcatch.eu/), I worked on developing advanced Deep Learning systems for vision and localization, enhancing the autonomy and accuracy of mobile robots through sophisticated localization algorithms and real-time obstacle detection.

I received my Ph.D. from the [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml) in 2023, where I specialized in Reinforcement Learning. My research primarily focuses on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and long-horizon decision-making. My thesis, [Representation Learning for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/688366#page=35), delves into these topics in detail. Currently, I am working as a Postdoctoral Researcher within the same group, continuing to explore and innovate in these areas.

Before moving to Barcelona I have been working at two research labs:

- At the [Blue Brain Project, EPFL](https://bluebrain.epfl.ch/), I developed Deep Neural Networks for generative vision problems, significantly improving rendering speeds using image reconstruction techniques.
  
- At the [University of Verona, Intcatch Project](http://intcatch.eu/), I worked on developing advanced Deep Learning systems for vision and localization, enhancing the autonomy and accuracy of mobile robots through localization algorithms and real-time obstacle detection.

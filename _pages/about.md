## Welcome

I am a Ph.D. student in the area of Reinforcement Learning at [UPF](https://www.upf.edu/). My main interests are in the area of Deep Reinforcement Learning with a focus on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning.

I am based in Barcelona where I joined the [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning group at UPF](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml) where I'm pursuing my Ph.D under the supervision of prof. Anders Jonsson.

Before moving to Barcelona I have been working in two other laboratories:

- [Blue Brain Project EPFL](https://bluebrain.epfl.ch/) developing Deep Neural Network for generative vision problems.

- [University of Verona Intcatch Project](http://intcatch.eu/), developing Deep Learning systems for vision and localization systems for mobile robots.
